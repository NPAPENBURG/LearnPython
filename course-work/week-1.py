#### WEEK 1 OF THE PYTHON COURSE ####
#####################################


# Explain what a variable is. What is its purpose?

# List the different types of Python Datatypes

# What is input function used for?

# Create a variable named color with a string value (Print the result)

# Create a variable named number with an integer value (Print the result)

# Create a variable named game_ended with a boolean value (Print the result)

# Store an input to a variable called age. Convert the input to an integer.
# Hint: You can use type() to check the datatype of a variable
# (Print the result)

# Create 2 variables that store inputs from the user.
# Convert the inputs to integers.
# Add or Subtract the 2 variables and store the result in a new variable.
# (Print the result)

# Create 2 string variables and concatenate them.
# There are 3 ways to concatenate strings. One is using the + operator ,f-string, and the other is using the .format() method.

# Note: Don't copy and paste code from the internet. Try to solve these problems on your own. If you get stuck, ask for help.

# Have a user input a color and a noun. Print the results of those as a superhero name.

# Create a program that asks the user for their name and age. Then print out a message to the user that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# Create a Tip Calculator. If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6. Format the result to 2 decimal places.
